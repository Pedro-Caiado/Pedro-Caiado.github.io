1 - link (URL) published portfolio website


2 - link GitHub repository (repo)


My portfolio aims to publicize my career in the past, present and future. I aim to show employers and people my knowledge as a person and as a professional. Considering that, I'm starting a new career in 2020, I would like to create online mechanisms to publish my projects and my career in general. 
In addition, it also aimed to demonstrate my knowledge in the area of web development, using my learning during this course.
There are a few futures and functionalities on the web site where the visitor will be able to access my LinkedIn account, GitHub from any part of the web site. They will be able to see a great slide show with 3 pics on it. Where it will be running at the home page. They will be able to access my contact details from the Portfolio and also get know about my life and my career pathway.
The portfolio has a home page as a start, where the visitor can see 3 images on a slide show. This will give him an idea of what will be shown on the website. It also has a career item where people can access my content as a student and worker during entire life. There is also my contact, where people will be able to contact me, either by phone or email. Another important function is my life style, where everyone will have access to my lifestyle when I'm not working or studying. Important mentioning that I will keep working on my web site throughout my career, even after I completed the assignment.
As a mentioned before, I target anyone who is interested in technology to check my website out and if it’s possible give me some tips of how to improve my knowledge as a web developer. I target an employer to look my web site and give me an opportunity to be part of their team as a worker. 
Considering my basic learning skills at the moment, I used HTML and CSS in this project. I had to improve a lot of my skills and get know a lot of subjects to get the Portfolio done properly.
I combined HTML and CSS together to explore more structure and style. I didn’t use any Java Script at all. So, everything that was done it was coding by HTML and CSS.
